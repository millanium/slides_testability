# Testability

## Classification of Testability

- epidemistic ("How narrow is the gap between what we know and what we need to know about the status of the product.")
- project-related ("Testability influenced by changing conditions under which we test.")
- value-related ("Testability influenced by changing the quality standard or our knowledge of it.")
- subjective ("Testability influenced by changing the tester or the test process.")
- intrinsic ("Testability influenced by changing the product itself.")

(Bach, 2015)

## Epidemistic Testability

- prior knowledge of quality -> much knowledge
- tolerance of failure -> little quality required or high risk tolerated

+++

## Project-Related Testability

- change control -> infrequent and controlled
- information availability -> complete and explicit 
- testware availability -> all relevant configurations
- system under test availability -> all relevant versions
- sandboxing or redundance -> disruptive testing
- test environment controllability -> all relevant configuration parameters
- time -> enough for most critical tests
